**Jeremy Meiss** is a Developer Relations and Community professional based in the Midwest.  He is currently the Director of DevRel at Solace, previously at Auth0, XDA, and numerous consulting gigs. He has spent the last 25+ years in technology, with a vast proportion of that in software engineering. 

> Developers donâ€™t care that you know, until they know that you care.

He is passionate about community and development, and the processes involved with each, and takes great happiness in evolving the understanding between companies and their technical audience. One could say he is driven to enable the technically savvy to be your greatest champions.

> To give real service you must add something which cannot be bought or measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity.
