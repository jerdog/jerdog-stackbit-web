      I am a Developer Relations and Community professional based in the
      Midwest. Currently the Director of DevRel at Solace, I was previously at
      Auth0, XDA, and numerous consulting gigs. I have spent the last 25+ years
      in technology, with a vast proportion of that in software engineering.
