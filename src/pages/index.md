      I am a Developer Relations and Community professional based in the Midwest. Currently the Head of DevRel & Community at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), I was previously at [Solace](https://solace.com), [Auth0](https://auth0.com), [XDA](https://xda-developers.com), and numerous consulting gigs. I have spent the last 25+ years in technology, with a vast proportion of that in software engineering.
