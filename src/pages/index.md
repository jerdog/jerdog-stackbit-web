      I am passionate about community and development, and the processes
      involved with each, and take great happiness in evolving the understanding
      between companies and their technical audience. One could say I am driven
      to enable the technically savvy to be your greatest champions

      measured with money, and that is sincerity and integrity. -Douglas Adams*
